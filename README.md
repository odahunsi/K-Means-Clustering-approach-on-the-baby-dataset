K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm which aims to identify homogenous group of objects in a dataset. In this study, K-means clustering algorithm was applied to a dataset containing characteristic features of pregnant mothers. The study revealed the optimal number of clusters available in the dataset based on mother characteristics, cluster relationships between the variables and the most important variable in the dataset was determined. Results showed a relatively distinct clusters with no outlier and found k-means a reliable algorithm to find clusters in a dataset.
